 * Expected input is from running `dotnet new --list`.
 * It should look something like below.
 *
 * Templates            Short Name       Languages
 * ---------------      -----------      ------------
 * ASP.NET Core         aspnetcore       C#
 *
 * We can parse this syntax based on the separator row. We
 * know the separators are hyphens (-), with spaces between each column.
 * Since the hyphens cover the length of the longest value, we can use the
 * index of the first hyphen underneath each field to index the fields.
 *
 * For example, above the first hyphen under "Short Name" is in position 21,
 * and the first hyphen under "Languages" is 39. This means that the values
 * for "Short Name" must be found on each line between characters 21 and 39.
 *
 * So, for each line the value of shortName is line.substring(21, 39).trim()
 *
 * @param rawOutput The output from running `dotnet new --list`
 * @retrurn Array of available templates found in raw output
