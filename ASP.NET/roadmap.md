# Project Idea: Basic Blogging Platform

## Overview

Develop a simple blogging platform where users can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. This project will give you experience with Razor Pages, Entity Framework Core for data handling, and basic front-end development with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

### Key Features

1. **User Authentication**
   - Implement user registration and login functionality.
   - Allow only authenticated users to create, edit, or delete posts.

2. **Blog Posts Management**
   - Create Razor Pages for listing all blog posts, viewing individual posts, and user-specific posts.
   - Implement forms for creating and editing blog posts, including fields like title, content, author, and date posted.

3. **Database Integration**
   - Use Entity Framework Core to create a database for storing user data and blog posts.
   - Implement CRUD operations for blog posts.

4. **Basic Styling and Layout**
   - Use Bootstrap or another CSS framework for styling.
   - Ensure your site is responsive and well-organized.

5. **Comments Section**
   - Add a feature for users to comment on blog posts.
   - Allow post authors to delete comments on their posts.

#### Development Steps

1. **Set Up the Project**
   - Create an ASP.NET Core Web Application with Razor Pages.
   - Set up Entity Framework Core with an appropriate database provider (e.g., SQL Server, SQLite).

2. **Implement Authentication**
   - Use ASP.NET Core Identity for user authentication.
   - Create user registration and login pages.

3. **Design the Database Schema**
   - Define models for users, blog posts, and comments.
   - Create migrations and update the database.

4. **Develop Razor Pages**
   - Create Razor Pages for different functionalities (home page, post details, create/edit post, user profile).
   - Ensure proper navigation and user flow.

5. **Front-End Development**
   - Use HTML and CSS for page layout and design.
   - Add interactivity with JavaScript as needed.

6. **Testing**
   - Test CRUD operations, user authentication, and navigation.
   - Ensure responsive design works across different devices.

7. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Deploy your application on a cloud service like Azure, or a hosting provider that supports ASP.NET Core.

## Learning Outcomes

- Understanding the Razor Pages model.
- Familiarity with Entity Framework Core and data handling.
- Experience with user authentication and authorization.
- Basic front-end development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Real-world application of CRUD operations.

This project provides a well-rounded experience, from backend to frontend, using the ASP.NET Core Razor Pages framework. It's a practical way to get hands-on experience with full-stack development in a Microsoft environment.
